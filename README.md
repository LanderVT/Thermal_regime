# Thermal regime
Datasets used to model and obtain the thermal regime of the Grigoriev ice cap and the Sary-Tor glacier. 

Content of this repository:


1) The climatic data of the Kumtor-Tien Shan meteorological stations:

* Kumtor-Tien Shan (3659 m) 
* Data is provided in timesteps of 3-hours.
* Temperature measured at 2m above the ground (Temp)
* Precipitation (Prec)
* Yearly (1 Oct - 30 Sept) precipitation (Pter)
* The provided .matlab file can be used to interpolate the 3-hourly meteorological data to hourly data.


2) The outlines of the ice masses (.shapefile).

3) The different boundary conditions under average 1960-1990 climatic conditions.

* Sir warming (warming due to superimposed ice formation)
* Snow warming (warming due to the insulation of snow)
* Temp (Average temperature of the upper ice layer)
* SMB (Surface mass balance)

Other data can be requested via lander.van.tricht@vub.be
